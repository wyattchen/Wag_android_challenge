This is my completed android project for Wag Inc. Every requirement of the challenge is explained in the classes 
under the JAVA files in the main folder. The only one that needs more explanation is the responsive UI. I have 
created 3 extra layout resource directories to handle all other screen sizes of the possible android virtual devices.
They are labeled as layout-normal, layout-small, and layout-large. Thank you for reading!
